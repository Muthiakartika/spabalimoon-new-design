        question: "Is Foot Massage the same as reflexology?",
        answer: "Not exactly. Foot Massage focuses on relaxing muscles, relieving soreness, and improving comfort throughout the feet and lower legs. Reflexology traditionally follows pressure points believed to correspond with different parts of the body. Our treatment incorporates selected reflexology-inspired techniques while remaining a relaxing massage experience.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can Foot Massage help after walking all day?",
        answer: "Yes. Many guests choose Foot Massage after sightseeing, shopping, or long walks because it helps reduce tiredness and discomfort in the feet, arches, heels, and calves.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does the massage include the lower legs?",
        answer: "Yes. Depending on your chosen session, your therapist also massages the ankles and lower legs to help ease muscle tightness connected to tired feet.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is strong pressure used?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. Pressure is adjusted according to your comfort. The treatment is intended to be soothing while still providing effective relief for tired feet.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I book Foot Massage at my hotel or villa?",
        answer: "Yes. Home service is available for selected hotels, villas, and accommodations around Seminyak.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does foot massage help neuropathy?",
        answer: "Foot massage may help relieve discomfort and promote relaxation, but it does not treat the underlying cause of neuropathy. If you have reduced sensation in your feet, speak with a healthcare professional before getting a massage.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is foot massage good for plantar fasciitis?",
        answer: "Foot massage may help ease tension and discomfort associated with plantar fasciitis. Gentle massage can be particularly soothing, but it should not replace professional treatment when symptoms persist.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I get a foot massage while pregnant?",
        answer: "Foot massage can be relaxing during pregnancy, but it is best to check with your healthcare provider first, especially if you have any pregnancy-related complications. Let your therapist know that you are pregnant so they can adjust the treatment accordingly.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why does a foot massage feel so good?",
        answer: "A foot massage can feel good because it helps relax tense muscles, stimulates the feet, and promotes a sense of relaxation. The combination of gentle pressure and soothing movements can also help reduce everyday stress and tension.",
